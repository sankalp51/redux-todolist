# Redux To-Do List App

This project is a to-do list application built with React and Redux. It features CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Redux Async Thunks for asynchronous data handling. The app integrates React-Toastify for notifications and Material-UI (MUI) for the user interface. The frontend is created using Vite, and the backend is a simple REST API.
